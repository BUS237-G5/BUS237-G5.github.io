        <h4>Risk mitigation - user productivity benefits</h4>
        <p>Organizations which switched to AWS saw far fewer outages impacting users or businesses. The IDC calculates that, as a result of fewer outages, these organizations will keep productive time and revenue worth $2.63 million per year <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite>.</p>
 
        <p>The IDCs report also reveals that AWS has enabled each of these organizations to achieve, on average, $36.5 million additional revenue per year <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite>.</p>

        <p>The IDCs report illustrates the huge impact AWS has had on improving study participants unplanned downtime. On average, organizations switching to AWS can expect 73% fewer unplanned outages per year. This results in 94% less productive time being lost to unplanned outages <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite>.</p>

        <p>These improvements can be further seen through the additional agility that AWS has given IT teams. IT staff saw an 82% level of improvement to the time required to deploy new computing resources, a 69% level of improvement to the time required to deploy new database instances, and a 90% level of improvement to the time required to deploy new storage resources <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite>. This additional agility is directly responsible for organizations being able to make their application development efforts much more efficient and effective. This results in delivery of more applications and features in addition to more timely delivery of those features.</p>

        <p>The IDC report also illustrates the important impact of AWS on organizationsâ€™ development efforts in terms of both their ability to deliver new functionality and the time required to do so. Organizations using AWS are delivering, on average, almost three times more features and see, on average, of 38% shorter development life cycles for new applications with new logic, a 36% faster development life cycle for new applications leveraging existing logic, while new features are being released 42% faster <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite>.</p>

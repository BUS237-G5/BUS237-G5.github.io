        <p> Amazon Web Services, AWS, is a leading company in cloud computing. The top three competitors for AWS are Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM. Microsoft Azure is an American multinational company. Azure provides up to 100 different services varying from application development, identity management, security, and data. <br><br>
Google Cloud is another American company. It provides smooth services and frees the users from managing infrastructure, configuring the servers and networks. The Google Cloud Provider, GCP, is engineered in a way to handle the most data-intensive work, allowing the flexibility to scale up faster. <br><br>
Lastly, IBM is a top multinational company. IBM serves their operations to almost 170 countries worldwide. IBMâ€™s core business includes manufacturing and marketing computer software, hardware, and middleware. IBM cloud includes Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS). IBM cloud offers their services through the cloud delivery models of public, private, and hybrid. <br><br>
AWS provides many distinct services that separate it from its competitors in the cloud computing market. AWS controls more than 30% of the cloud computing market <cite>(Miller, 2016)</cite>. This is more than all three of its competitors, Microsoft, IBM, and Google combined <cite>(Miller, 2016)</cite>. Each company has its own uniqueness and distinctiveness, still, AWS takes a spot at the top.</p>

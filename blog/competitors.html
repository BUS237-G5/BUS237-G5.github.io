        <p>Amazon Web Services, AWS, is a leading company in cloud computing. Quite naturally in the market for cloud computing, there are many competitors. The top three competitors for AWS are Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM. To begin with, there is Microsoft Azure which is an American multinational company with its headquarters in Washington. Microsoft Azure provides up to 100 types of services, with some varying from the use of hybrid consistency in various platforms like application development, identity management, security, and data. Along with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud is also a tough competitor to AWS. Google Cloud, an American company provides smooth services and frees the users from managing infrastructure, configuring the servers and networks. The Google Cloud Provider, GCP, is engineered in a way to handle the most data-intensive work, allowing the flexibility to scale up faster. Lastly, IBM is a top multinational company headquartered in New York, established in 1911. IBM serves their operations to almost 170 countries worldwide. IBMâ€™s main business includes manufacturing and marketing computer software, hardware, and middleware. IBM cloud includes Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS). IBM cloud offers their services through the cloud delivery models of public, private, and hybrid. There are many other competitors of AWS these, however, are the leading ones. AWS provides many distinct services that separate it from other companies in the market for cloud computing. AWS has continued to grow into an incredibly successful company. AWS has more than 30% of the cloud computing market in their control <cite>(Miller, 2016)</cite>. This is more than all three of its competitors, Microsoft, IBM, and Google combined <cite>(Miller, 2016)</cite>. Each company has its own uniqueness and distinctiveness, still, AWS takes a spot at the top.</p>

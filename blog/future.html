        <p>AWS had originated as a “side business” for Amazon (Miller, 2016). AWS, however, worked exceedingly well with “a remarkable $10 billion run rate” (Miller, 2016). The development of AWS stemmed from an e-commerce issue within the company that caused problems with scaling. The main issue that arose from such problems was during a service launch between Amazon and other companies. What created problems was that it was difficult for Amazon to make one main platform for various services that others parties could utilize together. There was a desperate need for secure and compact internal systems that all parties could access easily, rather than spending additional time trying to create databases. Such issues pushed the idea of making a better internal system that can adequately deal with the extensive amounts of growth that was before the company. In August, 2006, Amazon launched its first cloud computing service, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Such problems lead to the formation of AWS. Furthermore, after the launch and success of AWS it took some while for any competitors to appear in the market for cloud computing. The idea began as a side service and nothing that was thought offer it to become the face of cloud computing. Meaning, the success of Amazon Web Services was quite unpredicted or planned for. Regardless of the intent AWS has grown to take the number one spot of computing, with its competitors far behind in terms of revenue and quality of service. AWS continues to grow expansively in the industry</p>

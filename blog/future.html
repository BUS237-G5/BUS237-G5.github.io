        <h4>Benefits of AWS</h4>
        <p>The International Data Corporation (IDC) Is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets (“CANADA - Home,” n.d.).</p>
        <p>The IDC has released an in-depth white paper illustrating their findings from the studies of 27 global organizations running various enterprise workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS) (Larry & Matthew, Febuary 2018). This white paper illustrates the numerous benefits these organizations gained from AWS. Broadly, these benefits were found in the areas of; IT infrastructure cost reductions, IT staff productivity benefits, risk mitigation, user productivity benefits and business productivity benefits. The total accruing benefits for these improvement categories can be seen in the below “Average Annual Benefits per Organization” chart.</p>

        <p>AWS had originated as a “side business” for Amazon (Miller, 2016). AWS, however, worked exceedingly well with “a remarkable $10 billion run rate” (Miller, 2016). The development of AWS stemmed from an e-commerce issue within the company that caused problems with scaling. The main issue that arose from such problems was during a service launch between Amazon and other companies. What created problems was that it was difficult for Amazon to make one main platform for various services that others parties could utilize together. There was a desperate need for secure and compact internal systems that all parties could access easily, rather than spending additional time trying to create databases. Such issues pushed the idea of making a better internal system that can adequately deal with the extensive amounts of growth that was before the company. In August, 2006, Amazon launched its first cloud computing service, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Such problems lead to the formation of AWS. Furthermore, after the launch and success of AWS it took some while for any competitors to appear in the market for cloud computing. The idea began as a side service and nothing that was thought offer it to become the face of cloud computing. Meaning, the success of Amazon Web Services was quite unpredicted or planned for. Regardless of the intent AWS has grown to take the number one spot of computing, with its competitors far behind in terms of revenue and quality of service. AWS continues to grow expansively in the industry</p>

        <h4>Business and productivity benefits</h4>

        <p>Organizations are able to leverage the additional agility and performance stemming from AWS to generate more business. These Businesses can then rely on AWS to support their increasing needs and scale well with any new business opportunities that arise.</p>

        <p>These organizations employees also benefit as new functionality is put in their hands faster than ever. The IDC puts the value of higher user productivity and revenue at an annual average of $9.84 million <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite>.</p>

        <p>IDCâ€™s identified that organizations switching to AWS can expect excellent return-on-investment (ROI). The white paper showed that organizations invest a five-year average of $9.89 million and achieved benefits worth an average of $72.88 million per organization <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite>.</p>

        <p>The IDC identified that organizations investing in AWS can, on average, expect a five-year return on investment of 637% and can expect to breakeven on their investment within the first six months <cite>(Larry & Matthew, February 2018)</cite></p>

        <p>This return-on-investment is huge and all the more reasons why AWS so far ahead in the market.</p>
